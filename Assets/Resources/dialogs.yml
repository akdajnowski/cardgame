      The great volcano eruption tears the island apart as soon as you approach it. You stare at rivers of lava and through the shroud of thick smoke. You could swear that lava starts to pile up and take a human-shaped form.
      "It's a lava giant!" the second mate cries.
      The lava pile is over 15 foot tall now. Inside the head-shaped bubble on the top the mouth like hole opens and deafening roar tears the air. The monster starts approaching your ship. There's little time to make decisions"

      The island is sunken in deep fog covering giant rocks emerging from sea near the shore line. The shore is spiked with crashed ships wreckages. This fog is not natural.
      You look at your 1st mate. His face is tense.  He tells you a story he heard of this island. Of great treasures laying beyond guarded by terrifying dark forces.
      You carefully navigate through rocks and drop anchor in a bay. When your men step on the ground the army of trolls come out of nowhere and attack.

             They prove no match for your crew. After short battle trolls are defeated. The island is otherwise empty. Your crew takes parts of ship wreckages to
             repair some of your ship's damage

            The rite is successful - the trolls start to transform into humans! It turns out they were the sailors from the crashed ships. They help you repair your ship and
            offer to join your crew.
